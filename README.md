👋 Hi there. I'm a machine learning researcher interested in large language models and interpretability.

With my amazing collaborators, I have developed tools such as [TalkToEBM](https://github.com/interpretml/TalkToEBM) (which makes LLMs work with GAMs), [tabmemcheck](https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker) (which tests LLMs for prior exposure with tabular datasets) and [nshap](https://github.com/tml-tuebingen/nshap) (which computes compute interaction indices that extend the Shapley Value).

If you are looking for the code for one of my research projects, you will likely find it in the Gibhub account of the [TML group](https://github.com/tml-tuebingen/).
